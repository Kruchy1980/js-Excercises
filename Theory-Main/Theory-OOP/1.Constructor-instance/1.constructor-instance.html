        <ul style="list-style-type: '\-';">
            <li>Instance is an object created <em>accorcing with the constructor pattern.</em></li>
            <li>The emerging object is an <strong>independent entity</strong> that has <strong>its own properties and methods</strong> given to it by the reference object (constructor) and <strong>has access to the methods and properties</strong> owned by
                such reference object (by referring to the <strong>prototype of the constructor)</strong>.</li>
            <li>In many object-oriented programming languages we have the structure as the <strong>class</strong> on which objects are created. In JavaScript, this reference structure (which is a constructor function, but also ES6 is a class) is a <strong>set
                of instructions that are executed on the newly created object</strong>.</li>
