        <p><strong>What is 'this' ;)??</strong></p><br>
        <p>In Simply words this is a connection with some objects. This let's us to callbact to the object. </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Situations when we can meet with this</strong></p> <br>
        <pre>
            1. 'this' in global scope - in case of runtime environment which is a web browser the global scope is equal to /window.
            2. 'this' in function - you will use it mainly. This is created when is called back and creates the connection only than.
        </pre>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Strict mode.</strong></p><br>
        <p>Strict mode was created in JS ES5 for making the code more friendly. The strict mode we can define for only function or for whole file. The most recommended if we want to use it we should use it globally for all the file by inserting on top of
            the file:</p>
        <pre>
            'use strict';
        </pre>
        <p>The strict mode won't let us to defined attribution /przypisaÄ‡ the global object to this when it is under creation. Since the ES6 Class elements contain themselves the strict mode what makes the coding easier so from ES6 we do not need to use
            the strict mode because it is implemented automatically in a critical situations.
