        <p><strong>What is 'this' ;)??</strong></p><br>
        <p>In Simply words, this is a connection with some objects. This let's us to callback to the object. JS according to results assigned to this the connection with object. What the this is exactly the source decides. Assignement of the object to 'this'
            appears always in the moment of function callback - defined the character is not public. 'This' creates a context (object to which we can callaback inside the code).</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Situations when we can meet with this</strong></p> <br>
        <pre>
            1. 'this' in global scope - in case of runtime environment which is a web browser the global scope is equal to /window.
            2. 'this' in function - you will use it mainly. This is created when is called back and creates the connection only than.
        </pre>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Strict mode.</strong></p><br>
        <p>Strict mode was created in JS ES5 for making the code more friendly. The strict mode we can define for only function or for whole file. The most recommended if we want to use it we should use it globally for all the file by inserting on top of
            the file:</p>
        <pre>
            'use strict';
        </pre>
        <p>The strict mode won't let us to defined attribution /przypisaÄ‡ the global object to this when it is under creation. Since the ES6 Class elements contain themselves the strict mode what makes the coding easier so from ES6 we do not need to use
            the strict mode because it is implemented automatically in a critical situations.
        </p>

        <h2>Part 2</h2><small>- more practical information in 4.a.this-part2.js file from line 7.</small>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Why 'this' is needed??</strong></p><br>
        <p>'This' gives us no need of using precison functions(separate for each object).</p>
        <pre>
            1.It let's us to use the same function multiple.
            2. Code is cleared and easier to being edited  eg  

            function
            function showName() {
                this.name
            }

            Object 1
            const kate = {
                name: 'Kate',
                showName: showName,                
            }
            Object 2
            const michael = {
                name: 'Michael',
                showName: showName,                
            }
            Check the name of objects
            kate.showName(); //result display name of Object 1
            michael.showName(); //result display name of Object 2            
        </pre>
        <p>So we can see that once declared function showName is used to each of object thanks to 'this' word.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>When the connection with this arises??</strong></p><br>
        <p>The connection of this zrises in the moment of executing method and is not dependend of place of function declaration. In a moment of function execution the execution context appears and is a part of 'this'.</p>
