        <p><strong>What is 'this' ;)??</strong></p><br>
        <p>In Simply words, this is a connection with some objects. This let's us to callback to the object. JS according to results assigned to this the connection with object. What the this is exactly the source decides. Assignement of the object to 'this'
            appears always in the moment of function callback - defined the character is not public. 'This' creates a context (object to which we can callaback inside the code).</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Situations when we can meet with this</strong></p> <br>
        <pre>
            1. 'this' in global scope - in case of runtime environment which is a web browser the global scope is equal to /window.
            2. 'this' in function - you will use it mainly. This is created when is called back and creates the connection only than.
        </pre>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Strict mode.</strong></p><br>
        <p>Strict mode was created in JS ES5 for making the code more friendly. The strict mode we can define for only function or for whole file. The most recommended if we want to use it we should use it globally for all the file by inserting on top of
            the file:</p>
        <pre>
            'use strict';
        </pre>
        <p>The strict mode won't let us to defined attribution /przypisaÄ‡ the global object to this when it is under creation. Since the ES6 Class elements contain themselves the strict mode what makes the coding easier so from ES6 we do not need to use
            the strict mode because it is implemented automatically in a critical situations.
        </p>

        <h2>Part 2</h2><small>- more practical information in 4.a.this-part2.js file from line 7.</small>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Why 'this' is needed??</strong></p><br>
        <p>'This' gives us no need of using precison functions(separate for each object).</p>
        <pre>
            1.It let's us to use the same function multiple.
            2. Code is cleared and easier to being edited  eg  

            function
            function showName() {
                this.name
            }

            Object 1
            const kate = {
                name: 'Kate',
                showName: showName,                
            }
            Object 2
            const michael = {
                name: 'Michael',
                showName: showName,                
            }
            Check the name of objects
            kate.showName(); //result display name of Object 1
            michael.showName(); //result display name of Object 2            
        </pre>
        <p>So we can see that once declared function showName is used to each of object thanks to 'this' word.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>When the connection with this arises??</strong></p><br>
        <p>The connection of this arises in the moment of executing method and is not dependend of place of function declaration. In a moment of function execution the execution context appears and is a part of 'this'.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Summary now</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p> The source of arising 'this' is the call back of function/method. The connection rises undependendly of if in the function are we using this(as similar as with using event, and we can but no need to use it) </p>
        <br>

        <hr>
        <p><strong>The rules of arising this</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>The rules: </p>
        <br>
        <pre>
            1. The defined connection of this is a global object unless we are using the strict mode which won't let to be like that (undefined will be).
            2. The connection is clasified - What is an object of context, wjat is the source.
            3. Te Explicit bindin/connection - Simply we can tell to te function with what should it bind the this - the call and apply metodes.
            4. Hard binding - that is a binding which has fixed this - is created permanently.
            5. Binding with operator 'new' - appeares when the object is created and all the properties and methodesin  constructor/class constructor are assigned to the instance/object.
            6. Arrow function and this - Arrow function does not creating during the call back it own binding/connection with this but inherits it.
        </pre>

        <hr>
        <p><strong>Loose of binding problems</strong></p>
        <br>
        <pre>
            The problems appeares when:
            1.that = this - is to asign the this to another name:
            const that = this;
            2. Without function - with for of loop.
            3. Arrow function - does not creating the this just inherits it from the object.
            4. Bind - changes existing function for similar with binded this inside.
