            <strong>Private and Public Properties</strong>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            All the methodes and properties of objects are public in definition,
            but we sometimes want and can make them private. It is connected
            with encapsulation of data.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <strong>Hiding Data.</strong>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            We have two methodes to hide data of our objects.
            One is
            <em>Convention</em> and the second one is the usage of
            the
            <em>Closures</em>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <strong>Convention.</strong>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>The mechanism do not really hides the data but informs the programmers
            that the data are private so do not change them directky inside the object. </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <strong>Closures usage.</strong>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>That is the second method of hiding object data
            by using closures of data in methodes/functions.
            If the interface is created we can use our property
            which won't exists when the interface - our class will be erased.
            <strong>Need to remember that methodes used to get or set private 
                datas need to be created inside the <em>Constructor</em> <u>not</u>
                the <em>Prototype</em>.
            </strong>
