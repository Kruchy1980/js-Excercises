        <p><strong>Abstraction / Abstrakcja - explanation</strong></p>
        <p>
            <strong>Abstraction</strong> is an implementing tasks specified by the project, a simplified model of reality based on objects. These objects have a specific structure, interface and implementations, purpose, processes and, what is very important,
            having relationships with other objects.
        </p>
        <p>Relations between the objects - examples:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: '\-';">
            <li><strong>Composition</strong> object includes other objects. Composition assumes that one object is embeded in other one. Wherein embeded object is dependend of object which exixts in and it;s existense outside the object it is embeded in does
                jhave no sense.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Association</strong> Every object of that relation exixts independently. More of that there exixts relation (connection) between the objects. The existing of one object is not necessary for existing the other one</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Aggregation</strong> object consists from different objects(aggregates them). The main purpose and sense of aggregate(the main object) existing relies on possesion of objects which it's store (but these objects may exists outside the
                main one)</li>
        </ul>
