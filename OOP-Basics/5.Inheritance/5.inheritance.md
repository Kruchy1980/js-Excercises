# Inheritance / Dziedziczenie.
Thanks to **inheritnce** we re reducing quantity of repetable code. 

 It creates the *relation* between objects and *grouping* them.

Reducing of quantity of **potential bugs**.

### Inheritance in JS

The **Instance** has an access to common *methodes* and *properties* of class constructor and its constructor.

1. On the top(na szczycie) of the object is its prototype **prototype of object construcrtor**. Such a inheritance takes place accross  ***prototype chain***.

2. Some of the classes can get the properties of other classes (and extends them in such a class -  in JS it happens thanks to **estends** word.)
