# Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** - it is:
*Gouping/closing* methodes and proerties inside the object,
*Integrity and hiding data* - Controling the acces to the data should be done by object itself
Popular solution is using of methodes  as downloaders **(getter)** abd user accesors **(setter)** in specific object.
*Implementation* becomes hidden and the data access in one object is  availible to another object thanks to **interface**.
